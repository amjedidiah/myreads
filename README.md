[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5905f9a2b33f4824ac182d11a24ffd07)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/amjedidiah/myreads?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=amjedidiah/myreads&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A React **library** app that allows you to:

- add books to 3 different shelves: _Currently reading_, _Read_, _Want to read_

- move books between shelves

> It is also my submission for the MyReads project in the Udacity's React Nanodegree

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
---
git clone https://github.com/amjedidiah/myreads.git myreads
cd myreads
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage

<!-- TODO: Update demo video link -->
<!-- Watch this short [demo video]() of how to use the app. -->

#### Important

This app uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](docs/SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the **_only_** terms that will work, so don't be surprised if your searches for _Basket Weaving_ or _Bubble Wrap_ don't come back with any results.

#### Issues

A browser console error of 404 when searching for books.
However, it doesn't affect the search results or app's functionality.
