[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5905f9a2b33f4824ac182d11a24ffd07)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/amjedidiah/myreads?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=amjedidiah/myreads&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A React **library** app that allows you to:

- add books to 3 different shelves: _Currently reading_, _Read_, _Want to read_

- move books between shelves

> It is also my submission for the MyReads project in the Udacity's React Nanodegree

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
---
git clone https://github.com/amjedidiah/myreads.git myreads
cd myreads
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage

<!-- TODO: Update demo video link -->
<!-- Watch this short [demo video]() of how to use the app. -->

#### Important

This app uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](docs/SEARCH_TERMS.md).
That list of terms are the **_only_** terms that will work, so don't be surprised if your searches for _Basket Weaving_ or _Bubble Wrap_ don't come back with any results.

#### Issues

A browser console error of 404 when searching for books.
However, it doesn't affect the search results or app's functionality.

## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and Engineering student passionate about helping businesses and individuals create more value with the web while helping fellow students learn web development.

I recently spoke at a student conference organized by Microsoft Student Partners in South Africa.
Right now, I am working on the frontend app for EasyMall, an e-commerce store.

In the nearest future, I look to acquire mobile development and AI/Machine Learning Skills.
That way I can combine them with my passion for learning and teaching together with my web development skills to create even more value for more businesses and individuals, as well as encourage the early adoption of coding skills.

Do you need a website or a web app for your business/idea, a web tutor, or a conference speaker?
